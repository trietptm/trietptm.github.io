# Digital Forensics & Incident Respone Service

## Benefits
* Active response using state-of-the-art computer forensics technology
  * Determine if a malware intrusion incident has occurred
* Incident containment and remediation with a focus on permanently eliminating intruders’ foothold 
* Network hunting, memory and runtime state analysis detect indicators of compromise
* Log file and user activity audits identify suspicious activity and data exfiltration
* Determine the root cause of the infection/infection vector if having enough evidence (if applicable)
* Identify indicators of compromise/malware intrusion to detect other similar compromised systems
* Malware eradication steps (if applicable)
* Incident Response Playbook development after the incident
* 

## METHODOLOGY
* An Incident Response project is usually made up of the following steps
* PREPARATION
  * Understand the Incident’s Background
  * Define Communication Parameters/Plan
  * Forensics Readiness Preparation
* IDENTIFICATION
  * Remote/Live Data acquisition with computer forensic tools
  * Assess the Incident’s Scope and incident evidence data analysis
    * Deep analysis of memory dumps, packet captures, local logs, disk forensic images (if applicable) to identify malicious code
  * Involve the appropriate parties
* CONTAINMENT
  * Contain the incident to minimize its effect on neighboring IT resources.
  * Identify important servers/endpoints (CEO, CTO, Managers, Employees...'s laptops) to check for APT malware intrusions
* ERADICATION
  * Eliminate compromise artifacts on the path to recovery
* RECOVERY
  * Restore the system to normal operations, possibly via reinstall or backup
* LESSONS LEARNED
  * Document the incident’s details, retail collected data, and discuss lessons learned
  * Identify indicators of compromise/malware intrusion including file, registry, memory, network indicators of compromise (if applicable)	
* DELIVERABLE
  * Documentation including analysis of the infected server/endpoint and eradication steps (if applicable)
  * Presentation / discussion (optional)
  * Incident Response Playbook after the incident
*
